# Hashmap CLI Practice

## Practice Assignment

Using the data obtained from CLI, create a Hashmap that contains the name of the data, and the users answer, example:
  
  ```json
  {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Smith",
    "middle initial": "M",
    "address": "42 Wallaby Way, Sydney",
    "email": "jSmith@aol.com",
    "phone number": "555-555-5555" 
  }
  ```

  * If everything is correct, store the newly created Hashmap into an ArrayList. Then prompt the user if they would like to add another student. If so, ask the user the questions all over again, add the next user to the existing ArrayList. You will probably need to use a `while` loop to accomplish this. Otherwise end the program/break out of the loop.

  * Else, ask the user questions all over again.
